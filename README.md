#Achiefments
A Master Chief Achievement Browser.

The Master Chief Collection has far too many achievements and no easy way to browse them, so I started writing this.

##Working

* Only shows non-unlocked achievements

## To-Do

* Filter by type (skulls, terminals, score, time etc)
* Toggle showing unlocked
* Be prettier
* Add other Halo games
* Include achievement artwork
* Sorting
